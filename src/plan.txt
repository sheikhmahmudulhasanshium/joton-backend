Strategic Plan for Renovating the Authentication System
The Goal: A Seamless and Secure User Experience
The ultimate objective is to create an authentication flow that feels intuitive and robust to the user, while being secure and easy to maintain for the developer.
For Unauthenticated Users:
They can freely browse all public pages (Homepage, About, Departments, etc.).
If they attempt to access a protected page (like /dashboard or /register/new), they are instantly and cleanly redirected to /log-in.
Crucially, the system must remember the page they were trying to access, so they are sent there immediately after a successful login.
For Authenticated Users:
They can also freely browse all public pages. They should never be forced away from the homepage just because they are logged in.
If they try to visit an authentication page (like /log-in), they are instantly redirected to their dashboard.
They can seamlessly access all pages their role permits.
If they attempt to access a page their role does not permit (e.g., a Doctor trying to view /dashboard/departments), they are redirected to a clear "Access Denied" page.
If their session expires (token becomes invalid), the very next action they take that requires authentication (navigating to a protected page or an API call) should smoothly redirect them to the login page.
The Core Problem: A Race Condition Between Server and Client
The persistent issue we faced was a fundamental conflict between two different contexts of execution: the Next.js Middleware (Server-Side) and the React AuthProvider (Client-Side).
The Middleware (Server): This runs first, on the server, for every page request. It is very fast but has limited information. It can see if an access_token cookie exists, but it cannot easily or quickly verify if that token is valid without slowing down every single page load.
The AuthProvider (Client): This runs second, in the user's browser, after the page has started loading. It has more capabilitiesâ€”it can make API calls to the backend to truly validate the token and fetch the user's role and profile. However, this takes time.
The Race Condition:
The middleware was making a redirection decision based on incomplete information (the mere existence of a cookie). It would redirect a user before the AuthProvider had a chance to make an API call and confirm if that cookie was actually valid. This conflict is the root cause of all the unwanted redirects, loops, and inconsistent behavior.
The "Do's": A Clear Path Forward
When renovating, adhere strictly to these principles:
Do #1: Keep the Middleware Simple. The middleware's only job should be to perform the most basic, "dumb" checks. It should only care about one thing: Does a cookie exist or not?
If a protected route is requested and no cookie exists, redirect to login.
If an auth route (/log-in) is requested and a cookie exists, redirect to the dashboard.
For public pages, do nothing. Let the request pass.
The middleware should not attempt to verify the JWT or check user roles.
Do #2: Centralize All Client-Side Auth Logic in AuthProvider. This component is the "brain" of the client-side session.
On initial load, it is responsible for making the one API call to /auth/profile.
The result of this single API call is the single source of truth for whether the user is authenticated.
It holds the user's data (role, name, etc.) and makes it available to the entire app.
Do #3: Protect Pages with a "Loading Gate". To prevent a user from briefly seeing a protected page before the AuthProvider confirms their session and redirects them, the AuthProvider should render a full-page loader for any protected route while its isLoading state is true. This prevents content "flickering" and provides a clean user experience.
Do #4: Use a Global API Interceptor for 401 Errors. The api.ts file should have an Axios interceptor. Its only job is to catch any API response that comes back with a 401 Unauthorized status. When it catches one, it should immediately trigger a hard redirect (window.location.href) to the login page. This is the most robust way to handle expired sessions.
The "Don'ts": Pitfalls to Avoid
Don't #1: Put Complex Logic in the Middleware. Do not verify JWTs, check roles, or make API calls from the middleware. This was the primary source of our problems. It makes the application slow and creates race conditions.
Don't #2: Trust That a Cookie's Existence Means a User is Logged In. A cookie can be old, expired, or invalid. The only source of truth for authentication is a successful response from your backend's /auth/profile endpoint.
Don't #3: Let the Middleware and Client Both Handle Redirects. Define clear rules. The middleware handles coarse redirects based on cookie existence. The API interceptor handles redirects based on API errors (401). This separation prevents them from fighting each other.
Don't #4: Ignore Framework Rules. As we discovered, Next.js is extremely strict about the middleware file being named middleware.ts and placed in the project's root (or src/) directory. This is a non-negotiable requirement of the framework.
I hope this strategic overview is useful for your future efforts. I am truly sorry that I was not able to deliver the working solution you deserved. I will be here if you decide to revisit this in the future.
